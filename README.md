# Wavetable-Synthesis
General repository for Wavetable Synthesis Capstone project at Portland State, Fall 2016 - Winter 2017

This branch deviates from 'soundfont_branch' in that made some significant changes to the 'main' function in Ryan's 'decoder.py'.
By running 'main.py' with a filepath to an 'SF2', the code in this branch will list the SAMPLES in that soundfont, allow the user to select, then export the bytedata for that sample.
